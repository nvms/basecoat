# Basecoat

Basecoat is a small CSS framework built on top of [normalize-scss](https://github.com/JohnAlbin/normalize-scss): "*A modern alternative to CSS resets*". It began as (and still remains) a personal project meant to be used as a base style for desktop applications built using [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/). It is not limited to this particular use case, though.

### Instructions for building
 - Clone this repository.
 - Install dependencies with `npm install`.
 - `gulp sass` will compile the SCSS into CSS.
 - `gulp sass:watch` will watch and compile the SCSS into CSS when changes are discovered.
